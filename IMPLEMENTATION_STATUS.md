## 💡 Next Steps for Developer

### To Continue Implementation:

1. **Update Registration API** (`/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Add these fields when creating user
   await db.collection('users').insertOne({
     email,
     password: hashedPassword,
     role: data.role, // NEW
     companyInfo: data.role === 'company' ? { // NEW
       companyName: data.companyName,
       companySize: data.companySize,
       industry: data.industry,
       website: data.website
     } : undefined,
     createdAt: new Date()
   });
   ```

2. **Update Login to Include Role**:
   ```typescript
   // Store role in session/JWT
   const token = jwt.sign({
     email: user.email,
     role: user.role, // NEW
     userId: user._id
   }, SECRET);
   ```

3. **Create Company Dashboard** (`/src/app/company/dashboard/page.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   // Check if user is company role
   // Show: Active batches, Create job button, Upload resumes button
   // Display stats: Total analyses, Avg match score, etc.
   ```

4. **Build Bulk Upload UI** (`/src/components/company/bulk-uploader.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   // Drag-drop zone for multiple PDFs
   // Queue display with file names
   // Job description selection
   // Start analysis button
   ```

5. **Create Batch Processing API** (`/src/app/api/company/batch-upload/route.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Accept multiple files
   // Create batch record in database
   // Queue for processing
   // Return batchId
   ```
