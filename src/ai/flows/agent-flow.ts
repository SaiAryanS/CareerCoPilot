### 📊 Resume Analysis Complete!

Here's how your resume stacks up against the job description:

**Match Score:** **${analysisResult.matchScore}%**

${analysisResult.scoreRationale}

---

#### ✅ **Matching Skills**
${analysisResult.matchingSkills.length > 0 
  ? analysisResult.matchingSkills.map(s => `- ${s}`).join('\n') 
  : "_No matching skills identified._"}

---

#### ❌ **Skills Gap**
${analysisResult.missingSkills.length > 0 
  ? analysisResult.missingSkills.map(s => `- ${s}`).join('\n') 
  : "_Great news! No significant skill gaps detected._"}

---

${analysisResult.matchScore >= 70 
  ? `🎯 **Strong Match!** Your resume shows excellent alignment with this role!\n\nWould you like me to generate some interview practice questions to help you prepare?` 
  : `💡 **Improvement Areas:** Consider gaining experience or certifications in the missing skills to strengthen your candidacy.\n\nWould you like me to analyze another resume or provide guidance on how to address these gaps?`}

### 🎯 Interview Practice Questions

Here are 5 tailored interview questions based on the job description:

${interviewResult.questions.map((q, i) => `**${i + 1}.** ${q}`).join('\n\n')}

---

💪 **Tip:** For each question, prepare STAR-format answers (Situation, Task, Action, Result) using specific examples from your experience.
