# AI Agent Improvements - Llama 3.1 Integration

## Overview
Enhanced the AI Career Agent to work as an intelligent agentic system powered by Llama 3.1, providing conversational resume analysis and interview preparation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Agent Flow (`src/ai/flows/agent-flow.ts`)
**Before:** Used basic tool calling without proper context awareness
**After:** Implemented intelligent agent logic with:
- ‚úÖ Conversation context tracking across messages
- ‚úÖ Smart information extraction (job descriptions and resumes from chat history)
- ‚úÖ Conditional tool execution based on available information
- ‚úÖ Direct Ollama API integration for conversational responses
- ‚úÖ Automated workflow: gather info ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí offer interview prep

**Key Features:**
- **Context-Aware**: Remembers job descriptions and resumes from previous messages
- **Proactive**: Automatically analyzes when both job description and resume are available
- **Guided Flow**: Asks for missing information naturally
- **Interview Generation**: Offers interview questions for strong matches (‚â•70%)

### 2. Agent Page UI (`src/app/agent/page.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- ü§ñ Enhanced welcome message showing agent capabilities
- üé® Added "Powered by Llama 3.1" branding
- üìù Better descriptions of what the agent can do
- üí¨ Clearer call-to-action for users

### 3. How the Agent Works

#### Conversation Flow:
1. **Initial Greeting**: Agent introduces itself and capabilities
2. **Information Gathering**: 
   - User provides job description (via text)
   - User uploads resume (PDF attachment)
3. **Automatic Analysis**: 
   - Agent detects both inputs and automatically analyzes
   - Uses `analyzeSkills` tool with Llama 3.1
4. **Results Presentation**:
   - Match score with rationale
   - Matching skills highlighted
   - Skills gaps identified
5. **Next Steps**:
   - For strong matches (‚â•70%): Offers interview questions
   - For lower matches: Suggests improvements
6. **Interview Practice** (if requested):
   - Generates 5 tailored questions using Llama 3.1
   - Provides STAR format tips

#### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Agent Decision Logic
if (hasJobDescription && hasResume) {
  // Call analyzeSkills tool
  return formatted_analysis_results;
}

if (wantsInterviewQuestions && hasJobDescription) {
  // Call generateInterviewQuestions tool
  return formatted_questions;
}

// Otherwise, have a natural conversation using Llama
return conversational_response;
```
